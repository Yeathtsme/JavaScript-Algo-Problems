# JavaScript Algorithm Problems

## Reverse a String 
Given a string value, the program must return the reverse of the string. 

I have only provided one solution to this problem. It used the built in functions of split(), reverse(), and join(). 

## Factorialize a Number
Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

No solution has current been given by me. 

## Reverse the vowels in a String

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

Example 1:
Given s = "hello", return "holle".

Example 2:
Given s = "leetcode", return "leotcede".

Note:
The vowels does not include the letter "y".

No current solution given by me.
