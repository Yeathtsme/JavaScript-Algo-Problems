# JavaScript Algorithm Problems

## This Project

I want to improve my performance in technical interviews. Thus I'm creating this "Blog" to track, a problem I work on each day. The language  chosen for this is JavaScript. JavaScript being one of the most popular programming languages and generally one of the first languages a developer learns. I hope this "blog" also helps others solve problems.

The questions come from a variety of places arcoss the internet and books.

## Reverse a String
Given a string value, the program must return the reverse of the string.

I have only provided one solution to this problem. It used the built in functions of split(), reverse(), and join().

## Factorialize a Number
Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

No solution has current been given by me.

## Reverse the vowels in a String

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

Note:
The vowels does not include the letter "y".

No current solution given by me.
